## 2. 📌 Project Overview

- Customer churn is a major challenge in the telecom industry.
- Losing customers directly impacts revenue and growth.
- This project predicts which customers are likely to leave the service.
- Results are presented through an easy-to-understand interactive dashboard.

## 4. 🔍 Solution Approach

1. Data collection and understanding
2. Data cleaning and preprocessing
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
4. Feature engineering
5. Machine learning model training
6. Model evaluation and comparison
7. Deployment using Streamlit

---

## 5. 🤖 Machine Learning Models Used

- Logistic Regression  
- Random Forest Classifier  

**Model logic:**
- Models learn patterns from historical customer data.
- They identify customers with similar behavior who previously churned.
- A churn probability or risk score is generated for prediction.
